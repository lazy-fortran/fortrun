# *Lazy Fortran* Compiler Frontend TODO

This document tracks concrete implementation tasks for the *lazy fortran* compiler frontend.
Our architectural plans and designs live in `doc/plan/` directory, while this TODO.md is for specific actionable tasks.

## Vision
We are building a complete compiler frontend with a 4-phase architecture (Lexer → Parser → Semantic Analysis → Code Generation) that can target multiple backends. Our *lazy fortran* dialect pushes beyond all alternative scientific computing languages, exploring how far we can evolve Fortran to surpass Python, Julia, MATLAB, and others in both performance and expressiveness. Currently, we use standard Fortran as our intermediate representation, which allows immediate use with existing Fortran compilers.

## IMMEDIATE TASKS ⚡

### ✅ COMPLETED: Fix Existing Test Suite

### Standard Fortran Compatibility Tests 🔄
Since *lazy fortran* is a superset of standard Fortran, we need comprehensive tests to ensure any valid Fortran 95/2003/2008/2018 program passes through unchanged:

- [ ] **Create test/standard_fortran/** directory for compatibility tests
- [ ] **Fortran 95 Core Features**:
  - [ ] Program/module/subroutine/function structures
  - [ ] All intrinsic types and declarations
  - [ ] Arrays (static, dynamic, assumed-shape)
  - [ ] Control structures (if/then/else, do loops, select case)
  - [ ] Operators and expressions
  - [ ] Intrinsic functions
  - [ ] Format statements and I/O
  - [ ] Common blocks (legacy but required)
  - [ ] Data statements
  - [ ] Equivalence statements
  - [ ] Parameter statements
- [ ] **Fortran 2003 Features**:
  - [ ] Object-oriented programming constructs
  - [ ] Type-bound procedures
  - [ ] Abstract interfaces
  - [ ] Parameterized derived types
  - [ ] Allocatable components
- [ ] **Fortran 2008/2018 Features**:
  - [ ] Coarrays
  - [ ] Submodules
  - [ ] DO CONCURRENT
  - [ ] ERROR STOP
- [ ] **Test Infrastructure**:
  - [ ] Compare frontend output byte-for-byte with input for standard files
  - [ ] Test suite from Fortran standards committee examples
  - [ ] Real-world Fortran libraries (BLAS, LAPACK snippets)
  - [ ] Ensure no modifications to standard constructs

### ✅ COMPLETED: Test Cleanup and Deduplication

## Completed Phases ✅

- **Phase 0**: Test Reorganization
